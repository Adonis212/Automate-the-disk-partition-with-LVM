The script allows us to do :
the partition of the disk using the LVM tool, which allows us to define the group volumes, the logical volumes, the management of the size of the volumes, the automatic mount in the fstab file (file with all the mount points at startup), and the choice of the file system. ( ext4, xfs...)
